    <h1>Health Problems Related by Electric Gadgets</h1>
    <p><h3>To mitigate these health concerns, it's crucial to practice healthy habits, such as taking frequent breaks from screens, maintaining proper posture, adjusting screen settings to reduce eye strain, limiting screen time before bedtime, and incorporating regular exercise and relaxation techniques to counterbalance the effects of technology use. Balancing gadget use with periods of rest and engaging in a variety of activities can help reduce the risk of associated health problems.</p></h3>

        <h4> strain refers to a condition where your eyes feel tired, uncomfortable, or irritated due to prolonged use, typically from activities like reading, staring at screens, or driving for extended periods without breaks. Several factors contribute to eye strain, including prolonged screen time, poor lighting, improper viewing distances, uncorrected vision problems, or underlying issues like dry eyes. To alleviate eye strain, it's essential to take breaks, follow the 20-20-20 rule (every 20 minutes, look at something 20 feet away for 20 seconds), adjust screen settings, ensure proper lighting, and consider using artificial tears or prescription glasses if needed. Consulting an eye care professional can provide tailored advice and solutions for managing and preventing eye strain.</h4></p>

      <p>Insomnia refers to a sleep disorder characterized by difficulty falling asleep, staying asleep, or experiencing non-restorative sleep, which leads to daytime fatigue and impairment in daily functioning. Disrupted sleep patterns encompass various irregularities in sleep-wake cycles, including irregular sleep schedules, frequent awakenings during the night, or poor quality sleep.</p>
      <li><h2>Neck and back pain due to poor posture</h2></li>

      </body>
      <p>Neck and back pain caused by poor posture are common issues that arise from prolonged periods of maintaining an incorrect body position while sitting, standing, or working. Poor posture can strain muscles and ligaments, leading to discomfort and pain in the neck and back. </p>
      <li><h2>Increased stress levels</h2></li>
      <body>

      </body>
      <p>Increased stress levels refer to a state where an individual experiences higher-than-normal levels of mental or emotional pressure, leading to a feeling of strain, tension, or overwhelm. Stress is the body's natural response to perceived threats or demands, triggering a "fight or flight" reaction. However, persistent or excessive stress can have negative effects on physical, emotional, and mental well-being.</p>
      <li><h2>Radiation exposure</h2></li>

      <p>Radiation exposure refers to the process of being exposed to ionizing or non-ionizing radiation from various sources in the environment. Radiation exists in different forms, and exposure can occur through natural sources (like sunlight and cosmic rays), medical procedures (such as X-rays), nuclear power plants, electronic devices, and other man-made sources.</P>

      <img src="https://imgs.search.brave.com/gK6_oAFIFbRRHIkT2UujqizuryMJ5917nMuN1xlZsfw/rs:fit:500:0:0/g:ce/aHR0cHM6Ly9leWVz/YWZlLmNvbS93cC1j/b250ZW50L3VwbG9h/ZHMvMjAyMi8wMi9i/bHVlbGlnaHRnbGFz/c2VzdnNibHVlbGln/aHRmaWx0ZXJzLndl/YnA">
    </body>
    <p>Blue light filters are technical solutions implemented in electronic devices such as smartphones, tablets, computers, and even specialized glasses or screen protectors. These filters aim to reduce the amount of blue light emitted by these devices, as exposure to blue light, especially in the evening, can disrupt sleep patterns and cause eye strain.</p>
